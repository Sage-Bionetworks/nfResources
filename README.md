# nfResources
This respository serves as a catch-all to handle various [NF-OSI](http://synapse.org/nf_osi) related tasks including annotation updates, table-reformatting, milestone reports, and general status reporting.

### Currently Available resources
Here is a summary of what we currently have.

##### Milestone Reports
Milestone reporting is currenlty in [./milestoneReports/] and maintains code required to identify files updated based on milestone.

##### Project dashboarding
For individual funders we have built two shiny-based apps that track all ongoing activity.

| Funding Agency | Dashboard Location | Code Base | Table Updates |
